Answers to Hacking With Swift Coding Challenges


As of August 23, 2023

Strings Section:
- Are the letters unique?
- Is a string a palindrome?
- Do two strings contain the same characters?


The individual challenges are stored within one Xcode project where:
- In the main viewController's `viewDidLoad` method each challenge's tests are ran
- The tests are considered successful if the application builds and runs successfully
